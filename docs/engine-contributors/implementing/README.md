## 🎯 Current Development Focus

### Sprint Goals (November 2025)

Based on the roadmap, we're currently focused on:

1. **Stability & Error Handling** - Eliminating panics, improving error propagation
2. **Security Integration** - Connecting security framework to execution paths
3. **Testing Infrastructure** - Achieving comprehensive test coverage

### Before Starting Authentication Work

The following must be completed before authentication implementation can begin:

- [ ] All `unwrap()` calls removed from production code
- [ ] Security framework fully integrated with execution paths
- [ ] Test coverage >80% with all tests passing
- [ ] Session storage foundation implemented

**Details:** See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) → Critical Prerequisites

## 📁 Documentation Organization

This section is organized by the **type of work** needed:

### `/features/` - New Functional Features

These are new capabilities that don't exist yet (or need significant expansion):

- Authentication & authorization
- Database integration
- Template engines
- Email sending
- Background job processing
- Model Context Protocol support

Each feature document includes:

- Current status and gaps
- Implementation approach
- Technical design
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Testing strategy

### `/improvements/` - Non-Functional Improvements

These enhance existing code quality, performance, or maintainability:

- Error handling cleanup
- Security hardening
- Test coverage expansion
- Performance optimization
- Monitoring enhancements
- Code quality improvements

Each improvement document includes:

- Current state assessment
- Problems to solve
- Proposed solutions
- Implementation tasks
- Success metrics

### `/guides/` - Generic Implementation Guidance

Cross-cutting best practices and processes:

- How to add new features
- Testing guidelines
- Security checklists
- Code review processes
- Performance considerations

These guides apply to **any** feature or improvement.

## 🚦 Understanding Priorities

We use a color-coded priority system:

- **🔴 Critical** - Blocks v1.0 release, must be done first
- **🟠 High** - Required for v1.0, production-critical
- **🟡 Medium** - Important for v1.1, quality-of-life
- **🟢 Low** - Future enhancements (v2.0+)

**Current Focus:** All 🔴 Critical items must be completed before starting 🟠 High priority work.
