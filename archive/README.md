## When to Archive Documents

Documents should be moved to the archive when:

1. **Feature is complete** - Implementation plans after feature completion
2. **Issue is resolved** - Bug fix documentation after fixes are applied
3. **Analysis is superseded** - Analysis documents replaced by current versions
4. **Phase is complete** - Phase completion documents
5. **No longer relevant** - Documents that don't apply to current codebase

## When to Reference Archived Documents

Archived documents can be useful for:

- Understanding **why** certain design decisions were made
- Learning from **past approaches** to similar problems
- Tracking **evolution** of features over time
- Finding **historical context** for current code

## Current Documentation

For up-to-date documentation, see:

- `/docs/INDEX.md` - Comprehensive documentation index
- `/README.md` - Project overview
- `/docs/` - Current documentation organized by role
